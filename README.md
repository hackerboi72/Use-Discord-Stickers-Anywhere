Use Discord Stickers anywhere for free!
Discord has released the stickers feature recently, and it's only publicly available for Canadian users yet, however, there is a way to use them anywhere without having to use any VPN nor spending any money.

Disclaimer
I am not responsible if anything bad happens if you make a mistake with enabling the developer options, you should only do stuff in the console if you know what you are doing
Requirements
You either need Discord on your desktop or in a browser which supports inspect elements, such as Google Chrome
Step one: Enable Developer Options
There are two ways to do this, the easiest one is to buy a Developer License, but if you don't want to spend money, you can enable them the following way:

Go to your Discord client and press ctrl + shift + i
Go to the console tab
Now go to the index.js, copy the code and  paste it in the console and press enter
Step two: Enabling the Stickers experiment
Go to User Settings > Experiments
Type in the word Sticker and enable all experiments you see
Go to any DM or channel, click on the stickers tab in the lower right corner
Without Nitro, there is one pack you can claim for free: Hello Wumpus
You can additionally buy other packs, and/or claim ones that unlock if you have nitro
Now you can use them!
